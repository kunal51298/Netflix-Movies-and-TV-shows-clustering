# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-shows-clustering
The project discusses clustering which falls under unsupervised machine learning. The clustering is done on a dataset containing information about content on one of the most famous streaming platforms Netflix. This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flexible which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. The aim of the project is to cluster the data into optimal clusters. In order to      achieve it we performed Natural Language Processing, dimensionality reduction technique- Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
